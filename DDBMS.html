								<p> During my first semester as a senior at MSU, I was taking IT 440 class. The class covers PL/SQL, large scale modeling, database enhancement, and centralized/decentralized database environment .</p>
								<p> The instructor assigned us a multinational corporation scenario where we had to create a distributed database system for their operations and they were located in United States and United Kingdom. We were hosting MySQL databases in a master-slave configuration system in Ubuntu and CentOS7 virtualized environments. Every week we had to submit a milestone including wrote our own PL/SQL operations and generate reports. I was so excited when I could ping through 3 different databases (we had master-slave-slave) because we struggled a lot on this project and had to dig through various forums. We hosted the master and first slave in ubuntu and the second slave in CentOS, we chose a different environment for the last slave because we were not allowed to use only 1 environment.</p>
