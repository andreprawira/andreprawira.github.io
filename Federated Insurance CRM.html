								<p> During my last semester as a junior at MSU, I was taking IT 380 class. The class covers structured as well as object oriented systems analysis and design. We were also taught how to use Microsoft Access for the project on this class.</p>
								<p> Basically, the class was a long semester project. The third week of the class, the instructor brought guest speakers from Federated Insurance down in Owatonna. They talked about their work in the IT field and what us, the students could contribute for them using technology we could create. Moreover, they describe that CRM is the tool that they use most often, they also described what they wish they could have or could be improved in the CRM. For example, the CRM that they used at that time, did not have a calendar that can be integrated to Outlook. So, we created a calendar in the home page of the CRM itself. We also created a log-in page and that was one of the hardest part of the CRM that I had to create.
									In order to see, whether the CRM is working as they wished, we needed to supply a dummy data into the CRM. Ultimately, we had to present our CRM product to the folks from Federated Insurance. </p>
