								<p> One of the classes that I took during my final semester at MSU, was IT 310. The class covers data structures and algorithm concept, but we were using Java for any homework and exam. We studied the concepts of array, linked lists, que, stack, sorting algorithms, and trees.</p>
								<p> Furthermore, we were required to work on a final project and we chose Arduino robotic car. We chose to create a car because we think that it was unique and quite challenging. We refer to Google and YouTube a lot while working with the car. Each week we had to submit a milestone and every member of my team is responsible for something, whether it is the hardware or the software to run the car itself. I had a lot of fun working with the car, not to mention that we had 0 experience prior working with all the system that we used, whether it was soldering, wiring, installing modules and sensors, developing our own app using Android Studio.</p>
