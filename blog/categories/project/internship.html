										<h1>Internship</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="../../images/django.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p> My transition from a junior to senior at MSU which was at Summer 2018, was an eye-opening experience,
										I was lucky enough to be able to work with amazing people at Minnesota Valley Electric Cooperative as one of the
										intern. Specifically, I was the IT intern.</p>
									<p> Honestly, I did not think I was going to get hired because I honestly knew my skills were sub par at that time,
										and my competitors had more skills under the belt than me. But, I didnt give up because I love IT and that is where
										my passion lies. During 3 months of the internship, I learnt way more than what I learnt in class, not only I
										sharpen my hard skills but also soft skills. Overall, I was assigned all kinds of IT tasks, from setting up
										hardwares including web development. Specifically, there were 3 major things that I worked on without having any
										previous experience:</p>
									<h3>New hire checklist form</h3>
									<p>This was the first hard assignment that I had to work on. Previously, I havent taken any web design and development class at all. So, I watch a lot of YouTube videos and went to StackOverflow to get input from experienced
										people. The form was hosted in the intranet, available to everyone locally. Previously, supervisors who just hired new employees had to come to the IT help desk and fill a hand written form with the list of IT related item or clearance that the new employees will need.
										This was not an excellent option because help desk could lost the form or the supervisors handwriting werent clear. So, my supervisor
										wanted me to make an online form. I was able to do that using simple HTML, CSS, and Microsoft IIS.</p>
									<h3><a href="https://github.com/andreprawira/Web-Database-With-Django-Internship-Project">Web database</a></h3>
									<p>The second major assignment that I worked on was web database. Previously, the IT help desk stored important serial number keys for Microsoft
										Suite, Windows keys, hundreds of Apple devices serial numbers, and Adobe suite serial numbers in one Excel file stored in a server that only limited people
										can access. At that time, the help desk was the only actively maintaining the Excel file, but it got to the point where there were too many
										rows and columns, and it was difficult to go through. So, my supervisor wanted me to create a web database that is accessible using web browser but stored locally.
										It was not easy for me to complete this task. Not only, I did not know where to start, I also did not know how web database works. All I understood, was that I needed to import
										that Excel file to a database (I used PhpMyAdmin) then supply it to a front-end system. At that time, Python was my strongest skill, so I did a lot of
										research and I figured out Django framework. From there, I gained a lot of knowledge about how framework can help accomplish lots of things. Eventually,
										I had everything working using Python, Django, XAMPP, hosted in Windows Server 2012 R2.</p>
									<h3><a href="https://github.com/andreprawira/File-Comparison-with-Django-Internship-Project-">.CSV File Checker</a></h3>
									<p>This is the last assignment that was the hardest I have ever worked on my whole life. So, every month, the IT department receives
										a report in a .csv file that contains sensitive information regarding their members. One of the employees in the IT team had
										to manually find differences and discrepancies from the .csv file on that month and the previous month. It was time consuming and
										tedious job to accomplish that manually. So, my supervisor wanted me to use my Python skill to make a program to find the differences.
										At that time, it wasnt hard, all I had to do just code it in Pycharm on my desktop. But, when he wanted me to host it on the server, that
										is when my nightmare started. Although, I have the working code, I had trouble on putting it on the web. Because, at that time, the way I understood it
										, I needed to create a front end that I could upload 2 files then a simple run button, then it will take those 2 files to the backend,
										process it, then sends the output to the user so they can download it. It was very difficult and challenging, but I was able to do that,
										thanks to StackOverflow and my friend Yovin who helped directed me to the right path.</a></p>
