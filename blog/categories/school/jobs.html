									<p>In this article, I will talk about getting part-time, internship, and full time jobs as international students based on my experience.
									Legally, international students are only allowed to work in school and companies who are related
										to their major and even then you are allowed to do this with your CPT (internship) or OPT (
										full time jobs after graduation). In some cases, the government allows students who apply for
									financial hardship to work outside school and not having to use their CPT and OPT. However, you need
									to prove that you are actually suffering from financial hardship which is not easy.</p>
									<p>Getting a jobs in the states as an international student is difficult. When I lived in LA, I couldn't
									get a job in school (I've tried to apply here and there but no luck). When I moved to Mankato
									things were better as I got a job after being there for 1 semester. Getting a part-time job in the school
									is easy when you have a good connection, but it does not guarantee to get you a job, you still have to do
									the hard work. In the eyes of Americans, Indonesians who just graduated high school does not have anything on their resume
									other than their foreign high school degree and probably some clubs. Unlike American high school graduate,
									their resume is not the same size as Indonesian's post-it note. However, it is still possible for you to get a job.
									Again, I emphasize you to ask your friends who work in school to help you get a job. If things go well,
									you only have to make a resume. Now, you will ask how do I make a resume? My suggestion is <b>NOT</b>
									to ask people back home for a sample of resume. Indonesians resume are not applicable for the Americans.
									Instead, go to career development center, if your school has one and ask their help to make a resume.
									It should be free and you should do it, after all, you did pay your tuition. If you succeed, congratulation and be thankful
									for whoever help you got the job. Remember, dont underestimate your part time job because that might be the key
									to get internship or full time job.</p>
									<p>Getting an internship by far the hardest thing I have ever done in my life both physically and mentally. Internship is often perceived as your salvation to get a full time jobs in the states. Often times, internship is required
										if your major is part of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). When you do look for internships,
										watch out for companies who do not "sponsor" international students. In the states, not every company will hire international students.
										In fact, there are more companies who hire citizens and green card holders only than people who are under F1 visa or even H1B(working visa) in the states.
										You may be required to pay the school internship credits to take internship (this is where you need money to make money saying comes in). Not gonna lie,
										getting an internship is almost impossible as international students (keyword here is <b>ALMOST</b>). I remember I filled more than 80 applications from February until
										late April 2018 and I only got 1 offer. Sure there are international students who get internship without hassle but I can guarantee
										there are more international students who struggle to get one, so if you are one of those "lucky" people, dont be a <b>cunt</b>.</p>
									<p>In my experience, getting a full time job was not as difficult as getting an internship. I dont know why, but, I was able to get a job
									that I think pays well before graduation. One of my best Indonesian friend who majored in Mechanical Engineering and got 3.8 GPA got internship as easy as that. But,
									he was struggling a lot when he had to get a full time job (he did get one). One thing I need to mention, if you graduate
									from the United States, you are legally allowed to work for 1 year starting the day of your OPT (Optional Practical Training) card. You are also given
									60 days of grace period to stay or pursue your higher education degree in the states. If you graduated with STEM major, you are
									allowed to apply for an extension up to 2 years. Meaning, if you graduate with STEM degree you can work for 3 years, if you arent part of STEM, you only get 1 year. If this is your senior year and you are graduating next semester.
										Apply for graduation ASAP, apply for OPT 5 <b>months</b> before graduation if possible. Traditionally, you have to apply 3 months before graduation but in my case which is Spring 2019 graduates, the USCIS office
									received a backlog and it took them more than 3 months to produce an OPT card for international students. I got my card almost 4 months later (almost 1 month late). There are things you can do to expedite such as
									attaching an offer letter when you apply for your OPT, contacting the state representative, or member of the congress to expedite your case. Remember, you are not a citizen, you are not a green card holder. Your rights
									in this country is limited, when you ask for people in higher place for help, do not get your hopes too high, do not expect them to fully support you, if they do help you then say thank you, if they do not then good luck. Do not
									feel that you have the privilege to make them help you. If you wish to work here longer than your time allowance, consider working for a company that will sponsor you in the first place or marry an American.</p>
