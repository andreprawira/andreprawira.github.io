									<p>In this article, I will talk about handling your money and earning a little money while storing it. </p>
									<h3>Checking Account vs Savings Account</h3>
									<p>In the states, people typically use 2 type of bank accounts, checking and savings account. The former is a simple account that majority does not accrue
										any interest but you can use it to deposit and money whenever you want without any restriction. While the latter, is an account that you can deposit money
										and the bank will give an APY (Annual Percentage Yield), most brick and mortar banks offer very little interest, sometimes 0.01%. Meaning if you have
										$1000 in your savings account, assuming you leave it alone for 1 year, the bank will give an extra $10. Also, if you do open a savings account, you are allowed only
										6 times in a year to withdraw the money, if you do more than 6 times, there will be fees. See how shitty that is? Welcome to 'Murica. </p>
									<h3>Cash Account</h3>
									<p>Recently, startups have been hyping up a different type of account called with cash account. It is an account that works similar to checking account with some restrictions
									like no routing number, no physical bank, reimbursed ATM, but they give you better interest than interest than major bank's savings account. Personally, I have one
									Chase checking account and I just opened 1 Wealthfront cash account (2.07% APY as of October 29th, 2019) a week ago. The APY rates will depend of The Fed, if they lower the rates then all banks
										are required to follow the Feds. Regardless, I wish I had done this the first time
									I arrived in the states, it wouldnt matter much if its just 1 year but 5 years? I can earn some money by leaving the money in the bank. I also have an investment account
									with Wealthfront, they offer a service where they use artificial intelligence (robots) for people who are not savvy with stock trade, Wealthfront offers free service
									if your investment is not greater than $5000. My suggestion is leave $500 in that account and leave it for 4 years and see how much it will grow.</p>
									<h3>Conclusion</h3>
									<p>I have 2 accounts, one is Chase checking account and the other is Wealthfront cash account. The way I separate the money is that I count my total spending in a month times 2, that amount is what
									I always have in my checking account. Then, the rest of my money is stored on Wealthfront cash account. I also have $500 on an investment account that is free commission and run by robots in Wealthfront. You can also do 30-70, meaning 30% of your cash must be liquid in checking account and the rest
									in cash account. I personally do not recommend savings account because they often offer below 0% APY. However, Chase recently has been offering me to store $15.000 in their savings accoutn for 6
									months and will give me $225. If I compare storing $15000 in Wealthfront vs Chase for 6 months, Chase will win. </p>
