									<p>In this article, I will talk about earning money (and a flight ticket) while spending money. </p>
									<h3>Credit Cards</h3>
									<p>In the States, banks offers credit cards that come with benefits. For example, I got a <b>free roundtrip</b> plane ticket to Indonesia with Chase. However, before you open any
										credit card, you need a social security number. If you just got a social security number, <b>APPLY</b> for a credit card soon as possible. Why? Because, while you breath you will spend your
										money, and if you are going to spend your money, why dont you earn while doing it? If you apply for the first time, getting a top tier credit card will be difficult to impossible because banks will measure
										your credit score and well you dont have none. So, I recommend applying for Discover It for Students, which works for every single one of my friend who I told them to. Here is the referral if you want http://refer.discover.com/s/jjgy2f (we'd both get $50).
										The card gives you 1-3% cashback (some has to be manually activated per quarter) and it offers $0 annual fee and will double your total cashback at the end of the year. From there you can build your credit hitory and score,
										if you feel confident about your credit score, you can apply for Chase Sapphire Preferred, the card that gave me a free plane ticket. The catch is that you have to spend $4000 upon activation of the card. What I did was I paid my school tuition
										with the credit card because there is $0 fee for paying with credit card then they give me reward points that are equal to the round trip plane ticket back to Indonesia.</p>
									<br/>
									<p>Currently, I only use my Chase Freedom Unlimited which offers 1.5% cashback with $0 annual fee and closed my Chase Sapphire Preferred because there is a $100 annual fee after the first year and it served it's purpose. I do not
										use the Discover anymore because I dont like activating the 2-3% cashback every quarter. I always use credit card on very spending that impose $0 fee for using credit card. Keep in mind that the balance in your credit card <b>IS NOT</b> a free money.
										Every penny you spend on your credit card, you have to pay it back. So, use your credit card wisely and always pay on time! Treat your credit card as if it is your debit card.</p>
