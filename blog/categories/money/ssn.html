										<h1>Social Security Number</h1>

									<p>In this article, I will talk about getting a social security number, filing your tax, using Indonesia's - U.S tax treaty. </p>
									<h3>Social Security Numbers</h3>
									<p>If you wish to work in the United States legally, you need a social security number, it is a nine-digit number issued to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents. As an international student,
									you can get those number if you get a job in school. Often times, the department where they offer you a job in school will issue an offer letter and you have to take it to social security administration office and they will
									issue you a social security number. Keep in mind, this number must be kept safely and hidden, you should not tell these numbers to anyone except to certain parties (IRS, back office, car loan, apartment application, etc). Trust me,
									you do not want your social security numbers known by random people.</p>
									<h3>Tax Return</h3>
									<p>As a person who lives in the states, legally you are required to file your taxes even though you do not work nor you have a social security number. And I encourage
										you to do so. But, why? Well, you will get a TAX REFUND! That's right, the goverment will cut your paycheck before it arrives to you if you work legally and use
										your social security. But, often times you pay more than what you have to and every year you get the refund if you file your taxes. Your can also file your property tax on your
										expensive apartment rent and get a free $1000 more or less added to your tax refund. Also, you are not legally allowed to file tax on your student tuition but some
										of my friends had done it in the past and they get $1000 each semester. If you are caught, the IRS will ask the money back. So, in a year I always get $1500-$2000 free
										money by just filing my taxes which is for free as well (provided your school handles that otherwise you can use TurboTax).</p>
									<h3>Tax Exemption</h3>
									<p>Here is one of the good thing our government can come up with, it is tax exemption. With tax exemption, Indonesian citizens can exempt ourselves from tax up to $2000. Meaning, lu kerja dan dapet maximal $2000
										tanpa dipotong pajak sama sekali. All you need to do is go to your school's financial services and apply for tax exempt. You are allowed to apply for tax exempt for 5 years after getting your visa. Also, if you plan to
									go back home for good after staying <b>OUTSIDE</b> Indonesia more than 160 days, you do not need to file tax in Indonesia.</p>
