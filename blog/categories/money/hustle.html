										<h1>Hustle</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="../../images/hustle.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>In this article, I will talk about hustling a.k.a how to get a little money as a side gig. Keep in mind that you, as an international student (F-1 and J-1)
										are <b>legally not allowed</b> to work outside school. You are allowed to do that with CPT (internship) or OPT (full time job after graduation). The lists
									of things you can do to earn money below are legal to borderline illegal, do it at your own discretion.</p>
									<h3>Money Rotation</h3>
									<p>When you come the first time to the States, you will need a bank to store your money. Based on my own experience, banks like Chase, Wells Fargo, local credit unions or Bank of America offers you a bonus
									if you store money with them. Usually, you need to store a minimum of $1500 and they will give you $150-$300 a couple days later. The catch is, you cannot close the account and you
									have to keep a minimum of $1500 for 90 days (3 months). Meaning, if on January you open bank with Chase and they give you $150, comes April you close the account and you open in Wells Fargo
									and you get another $150, repeat that in a year you can earn free $600, cuma perlu niat.</p>
									<h3>Selling Plasma and Group Study</h3>
									<p>Now, this is what you call mixing effort and desperation. In the States, there are clinics that will buy your plasma (like Bioplasma) for $50 and unlike donating your blood, you can do it every single day. The catch is,
									you will feel very tired and very weak. Also, I need to mention that it has been a debate whether international students (F-1 and J-1) are allowed to donate, some officials say yes and some dont. I personally dont because
									I dont need money that desperate but my friends have done it in the past and never got into any trouble (so far). You can also go to the STEM departments in your school, often the biology or physiology departments
									create a study (sometimes you have to smoke weed or do a certain exercise, or eat certain food) and they will give you money.</p>
									<h3>Stocks</h3>
									<p>If you have an extra money and would not mind risking your money, you are allowed to buy and sell stocks. I personally would recommend Robinhood because they offer $0
									commission trades. Also, Robinhood is very user friendly and their blogs are concise and clear for new traders to use.</p>
									<h3>Financial Hardships</h3>
									<p>If for any reason, you and your family suffers an act of God incident that cripple you financially. You can file a financial hardship case to USCIS, if they approve your case,
									you are legally allowed to work outside school. However, you actually need cold hard facts that you are suffering financial hardship. Not some bullshit you can whip out in front of your parents.</p>
									<h3>Brave Browser</h3>
									<p>Now this is not much, but it is aleast something. If you have a personal device, whether it is your smartphone, tablet, or laptops. I guarantee you use browser (Safari, Chrome, Edge, etc).
									While using those browsers are free, they collect and sell your data. If you use Browser which uses Chromium (Chrome engine) you can opt-in to receive ads and get paid in form of a cryptocurrency (BAT).
									Again, it is not a lot and if you use browser a lot, in a year you probably can earn up to $15.</p>
									<h3>Referral</h3>
									<p>Advertisement is big in the states and almost all the time, whenever you use a service or buy an item, the seller will always offer you to "market"
										their stuff to your friends and family and you'd get a little something in return. I started sharing my referral 1 and a half years before I graduate,
										and I manage to get more than $800. This is the way it works, you open a credit card with any bank, they will give you a referral link and when you
										share it and someone else uses it, both of you get a little something. For example, if you use a referral link for Discover credit card, you both get $50,
										it is a win-win situation for both of you. I will list all my referral links at the bottom of the page if you wish to use them.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>https://accounts.chase.com/raf/share/2310121151 (Open a checking account with Chase and we both would get $50) </li>
										<li>https://www.referyourchasecard.com/18a/YJYMFZN0B0 (Open a Chase freedom unlimited card and earn $200 cash back after you spend $500 in the first three months your account is open)</li>
										<li>http://refer.discover.com/s/jjgy2f (Open a Discover credit card and we both would get $50)</li>
										<li>http://fbuy.me/n2q6D (Mint mobile we both get $15/month/3GB LTE)</li>
										<li>https://www.wealthfront.com/c/affiliates/invited/AFFC-8VLW-V4NH-N7BW (Wealthfront investment account we both get $5,000 managed for free)</li>
										<li>https://invite.robinhood.com/andrep445 (Robinhood offers a no cost stock trading platform, use the link and we both get one random stock)</li>
